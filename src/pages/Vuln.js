          Near the end of 2021 there was a massive vulnerability discovered and
          announced to be one of the most serious vulnerabilities seen in modern
          web. This infrastructure vulnerability had already been exploited
          millions of times and had the potential to expose billions of users.
          Engineers had to move quickly to patch the issue and this brought the
          attention of executives to better track vulnerabilities and risks
          within their organizations.
        </Paragraph2>
        <Paragraph2>
          IBM was no stranger to this and began regularly tracking
          vulnerabilities and risks of each department monthly from a number of
          their various vulnerability tracking applications.
